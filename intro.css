/* CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the 
presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHMTL).

CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, 
or on other media. It allows web developers to control the layout, appearance,
and style of multiple web pages all at once.
